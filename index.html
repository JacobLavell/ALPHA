            The rebellion started as an anti-imperialist, anti-foreign and

            Militia (United in Righteousness), and later supported by Qing
            Empress Cixi. In response, the Eight-Nation Alliance sent troops to
            Beijing and defeated the Boxer militia and supporting Qing troops,
            followed by uncontrollable plunders and destructions. The Qing
            government paid billions in indemnity.

        </div>
        <p>
          After the First and Second Opium Wars (1839-42, 1856-60), the
          Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), as well as the other forms of
          imperialists invasion in China, the Chinese felt threatened by outside
          powers. However, since China lacked a modernized military and had
          incurred millions of causalities from the wars, the Qing government
          was incapable of protecting the people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other groups stepped up to fulfill the role. By the late 1890s, a
          Chinese secret group, the Society of Righteous and Harmonious Fists,
          had begun carrying out regular attacks on foreign missionaries and
          Chinese Christians. This was the beginning of the anti-foreigner Boxer
          Rebellion.
        </p>
        <h3>The militia united in righteousness</h3>
        <p>
          A Chinese secret organization in the late Qing dynasty in China, known
          as “Boxers” in English due to its participants being well-trained in
          martial arts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their goal was to lead an uprising in Northern China against the
          spread of Western and Japanese imperialism across Chinese territory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Provincial leaders and the Chinese imperial court varied in their
          stances towards thee group, since Boxer activity spread widely; there
          was no unified government response.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their slogan: “Support the Qing government and exterminate the
          foreigners” (扶清滅洋​)
        </p>
        <h3>Uprising of the Boxers</h3>
        <p>
          As foreign influence expanded rapidly in China, the supporters of
          Boxers also increased exponentially with the intent of restoring
          Chinese's domination and culture. Initially, The Qing government
          remained silence towards the boxer movement. Violence against Western
          power and missionaries began to intensify. As a result, foreign powers
          pressured the Imperial authority to defend the Christian communities.
          In order to blunt the Boxers' threat to the dynasty, the Qing empress
          (Cixi) sided with Boxers against Westerners. However, the Boxer
          Rebellion was soon put down by the troops of the Eight-Nation
          Alliance.
        </p>
        <h3>The Eight-Nation Alliance</h3>
        <p>
          Background of the Eight-Nation Alliance: The Boxers had been attacking
          and killing foreign missionaries across northern China, with the Qing
          government tacitly condoning their actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In response to the Rebellions, Germany, Japan, Russia, Britain,
          France, United States, Italy, and Austria-Hungary sent approximately
          45,000 troops to Northern China. This would be known as the
          Eight-Nation Alliance.
        </p>
        <h3>The Battle of Beijing (August 14 - August 15, 1900)</h3>
        <p>
          By August of 1900, the movement of Boxers had spread to Beijing. Their
          actions included torching Western churches, murdering Chinese
          Christians and attacking foreigners in Beijing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Britain led the Eight-Nation Alliance to rescue the besieged foreign
          citizens in Beijing from 14th and 15th August 1900.
